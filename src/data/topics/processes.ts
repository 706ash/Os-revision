  description: 'Covers the fundamental concepts of processes in an operating system, including PCB, process states, operations, and context switching.',
  overview: 'Process Management is a core responsibility of any operating system. It involves creating, scheduling, and terminating processes, maintaining their states, and switching between them efficiently. Understanding these concepts helps in analyzing how multitasking, resource allocation, and CPU scheduling work.',
